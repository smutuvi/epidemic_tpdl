. O

The O
main O
causes O
of O

identified O
by O

were O
having O

the O

51 O
% O
of O
respondents O
said O
community O
nurse O
workloads O
in O
their O
area O
were O
significantly O
higher O
as O
a O
result O
. O

A O
quarter O
of O
nurses O
said O
they O
were O
rarely O
confident O
that O

received O
the O
right O
quantity O
and O
quality O
of O
community O
health O
and O
social O
care O
provision O
once O
they O
were O
discharged O
from O
hospital O
. O

Respondents O
blamed O
this O
lack O
of O
confidence O
on O
understaffing O
in O

poor O

older O

This O
not O
only O
is O
distressing O
for O

also O
makes O
no O

financially O

the O
cost O
of O

higher O

” O
She O
added O

” O
Queen O

Nursing O

Rosemary O

said O
the O
causes O

She O
said O
: O
“ O
We O
know O
that O

rather O

are O
usually O

” O
“ O
The O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
readiness O
of O
the O
community O
to O
receive O
people O
back O
for O

, O
Ms O

some O

she O
said O

The O
secret O
lies O
in O
a O
regular O

giving O
foods O
rich O
in O
antioxidants O

controversial O

the O

: O
over O
125 O

However O
the O
challenge O
for O

is O
to O
sustain O
this O

Minister O

provincial O
finance O
ministers O
not O
that O
they O
would O
begin O
discussing O
a O
new O
arrangement O
but O
that O
the O
federal O
government O
had O
decided O
to O
hold O
the O
annual O
increase O
in O
the O
transfer O
to O
six O
per O
cent O
until O
2016 O
17 O
, O
which O
is O
the O
current O
rate O
Ottawa O
gives O
the O
provinces O
. O

Starting O
in O
2017 O
18 O
, O
however O
, O
federal O
health O
transfer O
increases O
will O
be O
linked O
to O
the O
rate O
of O
the O
country O
' O
s O
economic O
growth O
including O
inflation O
which O
is O
about O
four O
per O
cent O
but O
there O
will O
be O
a O
floor O
of O
three O
per O
cent O
. O

There O
is O
much O
that O
can O
be O
criticized O
about O
this O
solution O
to O
the O
health O
transfer O
issue O
. O

It O
appears O
to O
herald O
a O
departure O
of O
the O
federal O
government O
from O
any O
attempt O
at O
national O
health O
standards O
or O
fostering O
innovation O
as O
the O
money O
is O
to O
be O
transferred O
no O
strings O
attached O
. O

Thus O
, O
there O
is O
no O
federal O
commitment O
to O
try O
to O
improve O
health O
care O
delivery O
. O

Federal O
Health O
Minister O
Leona O
Aglukkaq O
has O
stated O
future O
federal O
provincial O
discussions O
will O
now O
be O
more O
about O
performance O
measurement O
, O
accountability O
and O
sharing O
of O
best O
practices O
rather O
than O
money O
. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
health O
, O
critics O
might O
argue O
Canada O
now O
has O
the O
federation O
from O
Star O
Trek O
with O
the O
role O
of O
the O
federal O
government O
being O
simply O
to O
observe O
and O
report O
rather O
than O
involve O
itself O
in O
provincial O
affairs O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
one O
has O
to O
conclude O
that O
given O
that O
health O
is O
a O
provincial O
sphere O
of O
jurisdiction O
, O
the O
federal O
transfer O
solution O
is O
both O
clever O
and O
sound O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
cleverness O
, O
announcing O
the O
new O
arrangement O
the O
week O
before O
Christmas O
when O
the O
public O
' O
s O
attention O
was O
elsewhere O
was O
inspired O
. O

And O
if O
they O
were O
paying O
any O
attention O
they O
would O
merely O
note O
Ottawa O
was O
giving O
money O
the O
Christmas O
gift O
that O
is O
always O
appreciated O
making O
complainers O
seem O
ungrateful O
. O

Moreover O
, O
Ottawa O
is O
maintaining O
six O
per O
cent O
increases O
until O
2017 O
the O
world O
should O
last O
so O
long O
. O

The O
fact O
is O
the O
provinces O
have O
stable O
federal O
funding O
to O
plan O
for O
the O
day O
when O
growth O
in O
federal O
transfers O
slows O
. O

Federal O
health O
transfers O
are O
a O
key O
component O
of O
provincial O
health O
spending O
, O
accounting O
for O
about O
20 O
per O
cent O
of O
their O
expenditures O
and O
are O
therefore O
an O
important O
driver O
of O
spending O
. O

The O
federal O
government O
is O
creating O
the O
incentive O
for O
provinces O
to O
bend O
the O
health O
care O
cost O
curve O
but O
gradually O
and O
without O
a O
one O
size O
fits O
all O
policy O
. O

One O
of O
the O
advantages O
of O
a O
federal O
form O
of O
government O
is O
that O
it O
can O
foster O
diversity O
and O
innovation O
in O
the O
production O
and O
delivery O
of O
public O
services O
. O

The O
provinces O
now O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
do O
just O
that O
to O
health O
care O
. O

The O
money O
, O
however O
, O
is O
being O
transferred O
with O
no O
strings O
attached O
, O
no O
push O
for O
national O
standards O
. O

Those O
who O
might O
want O
to O
see O
future O
federal O
action O
on O
a O
national O
drug O
plan O
will O
be O
disappointed O
. O

Those O
who O
see O
the O
role O
of O
the O
federal O
government O
as O
an O
enforcer O
of O
regional O
equity O
in O
health O
care O
services O
will O
also O
be O
disappointed O
. O

Those O
provinces O
currently O
unhappy O
with O
the O
new O
transfer O
deal O
, O
however O
, O
would O
also O
cry O
lamentations O
of O
domineering O
federalism O
and O
unwarranted O
federal O
intrusion O
if O
the O
federal O
government O
became O
more O
interventionist O
in O
applying O
national O
heath O
standards O
. O

The O
federal O
government O
has O
extricated O
itself O
from O
these O
types O
of O
political O
health O
funding O
operas O
and O
in O
future O
all O
the O
provinces O
will O
be O
more O
careful O
about O
what O
they O
wish O
for O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
amounts O
are O
reasonable O
. O

Six O
per O
cent O
until O
2017 O
means O
five O
more O
years O
of O
federal O
transfer O
growth O
well O
in O
excess O
of O
GDP O
growth O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
given O
population O
growth O
and O
inflation O
, O
it O
means O
a O
freeze O
in O
real O
per O
capita O
federal O
health O
transfers O
after O
2017 O
. O

This O
is O
where O
the O
challenge O
lies O
. O

For O
provinces O
with O
booming O
economies O
and O
relatively O
young O
populations O
, O
a O
freeze O
in O
real O
per O
capita O
federal O
health O
transfers O
will O
allow O
innovation O
and O
experimentation O
. O

For O
provinces O
with O
rapidly O
aging O
populations O
and O
slower O
economic O
growth O
Eastern O
Canada O
the O
result O
will O
be O
a O
serious O
fiscal O
crunch O
. O

Ontario O
and O
Quebec O
already O
have O
extremely O
challenging O
deficit O
and O
debt O
situations O
and O
they O

All O
this O

the O
fact O
that O
