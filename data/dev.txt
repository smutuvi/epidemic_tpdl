Several O
reports O
today O
suggest O
that O
a O
study O
of O
the O
brains O
of O
people O
who O
excessively O
use O
the O
internet O
show O
abnormalities O
similar O
to O
those O
found O
in O
people O
with O
substance O
addictions O
could O
be O
proof O
that O
the O

has O
similar O
addictive O
qualities O
to O
drugs O
, O
alcohol O
or O
tobacco O
. O

The O
Independent O
' O

report O
here O
is O
the O
most O
extensive O
. O

It O
says O
: O
Internet O
addiction O
has O
for O
the O
first O
time O
been O
linked O
with O
changes O
in O
the O

similar O
to O
those O
seen O
in O
people O
addicted O
to O
alcohol O
, O
cocaine O
and O
cannabis O
. O

In O
a O
groundbreaking O
study O
, O
researchers O
used O
MRI O
scanners O
to O
reveal O
abnormalities O
in O
the O
brains O
of O
adolescents O
who O
spent O
many O
hours O
on O
the O

, O
to O
the O
detriment O
of O
their O
social O
and O
personal O
lives O
. O

The O
finding O
could O
throw O
light O
on O
other O
behavioural O
problems O
and O
lead O
to O
the O
development O
of O
new O
approaches O
to O

, O
researchers O
said O
. O

An O
estimated O
5 O
to O
10 O
per O
cent O
of O
internet O
users O
are O
thought O
to O
be O
addicted O
– O
meaning O
they O
are O
unable O
to O
control O
their O
use O

The O
majority O
are O
games O
players O
who O
become O
so O
absorbed O
in O
the O

they O
go O
without O

for O
long O
periods O

their O

suffer O
. O

But O
is O
there O
really O
such O
a O
thing O
as O
internet O
addiction O
? O

The O
claim O

The O
abstract O
says O
: O
Background O
Internet O
addiction O
disorder O
( O
IAD O
) O
is O
currently O
becoming O
a O
serious O
mental O
health O
issue O
around O
the O
globe O
. O

Previous O
studies O
regarding O
IAD O
were O
mainly O
focused O
on O
associated O
psychological O
examinations O
. O

However O
, O
there O
are O
few O
studies O
on O
brain O
structure O
and O
function O
about O
IAD O
. O

In O
this O
study O
, O
we O
used O
diffusion O

( O

) O
to O
investigate O
white O

in O

Principal O
Findings O
Seventeen O
IAD O
subjects O
and O
sixteen O
healthy O

without O
IAD O
participated O
in O
this O

. O

Whole O
brain O

analysis O
of O

was O
performed O
by O

( O

) O
to O
localize O
abnormal O
white O

between O
groups O
. O

TBSS O
demonstrated O
that O
IAD O
had O
significantly O
lower O
FA O

the O

. O

In O
most O
VOIs O
, O
FA O
reductions O
were O
caused O
by O
an O

no O

within O
the O
IAD O
group O

Significantly O
negative O

were O
found O
between O

values O
in O

Conclusions O
Our O
findings O
suggest O
that O
IAD O
demonstrated O
widespread O
reductions O
of O
FA O
in O
major O
white O
matter O
pathways O
and O
such O
abnormal O
white O
matter O
structure O
may O
be O
linked O
to O
some O
behavioral O
impairments O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
white O
matter O
integrity O
may O
serve O
as O
a O
potential O
new O
treatment O
target O
and O
FA O
may O
be O
as O
a O
qualified O
biomarker O
to O
understand O
the O
underlying O
neural O
mechanisms O
of O
injury O
or O
to O
assess O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
specific O
early O
interventions O
in O
IAD O
. O

I O
' O
m O
going O
to O
look O
into O
whether O
internet O
addiction O
is O
considered O
a O
medical O
condition O
. O

I O
' O
m O
also O
curious O
about O
the O
source O
of O
claims O
that O
5 O
10 O
% O
of O

are O
addicted O
and O
unable O
to O
control O
their O
use O
and O
report O
back O
. O

I O
also O
wonder O
whether O
internet O

is O
always O
a O
bad O
thing O
? O

Analysis O
The O
Royal O
College O
of O
Psychiatrists O
told O
me O
that O
psychiatrists O
in O
the O
UK O
refer O
to O
two O
international O
sources O
to O
define O
whether O
a O
set O
of O
symptoms O
is O
a O
diagnosable O
illness O
or O
not O
. O

The O
World O
Health O
Organisation O
publishes O
International O
Classification O
of O
Diseases O
periodically O
, O
but O
the O
last O
came O
into O
use O
in O
1994 O
and O
therefore O
inevitably O
includes O
no O
reference O
to O
the O
internet O
. O

The O
other O
source O
is O
the O
American O
Psychiatric O
Association O
' O
s O
Diagnostic O
and O
Statistical O
Manual O
of O
Mental O
Disorders O
, O
which O
is O
due O
to O
be O
updated O
next O
year O
. O

The O
committees O
responsible O
for O
formulating O
this O
policy O
has O
been O
debating O
whether O
to O
include O
internet O
addiction O
in O
its O
section O
on O
addictions O
. O

The O
current O
proposals O
reclassify O
internet O
gambling O
as O
an O
addiction O
rather O
than O
a O
compulsive O
behaviour O
but O
don O
' O
t O
include O
internet O
addiction O
in O
its O
own O
right O
. O

This O
is O
still O
open O
to O
consultation O
, O
fiercely O
contested O
and O
subject O
to O
new O
evidence O
, O
including O
potentially O
the O
Chinese O
study O
. O

Last O
year O
Charles O
O O
' O
Brien O
of O
the O
University O
of O
Pennsylvania O
, O
the O
chair O
of O
the O
addictions O
committee O
, O
said O
in O
a O
press O
conference O
reported O
here O
, O
that O
internet O
addiction O
would O
not O
be O
included O
but O
that O
they O
would O
recommend O
future O
research O
in O
the O
area O
. O

The O
report O
said O
: O
He O
[ O
O O
' O
Brien O
] O
said O
his O
work O
group O
had O
considered O
including O
sex O
and O
Internet O
addictions O
as O
disorders O
, O
but O
decided O
there O
was O
insufficient O
evidence O
to O
allow O
development O
of O
reliable O
diagnostic O
criteria O
for O
them O
. O

Consequently O
, O
gambling O
addiction O
is O
slated O
to O
be O
the O
only O
disorder O
formally O
listed O
in O
the O
behavioral O
addictions O
category O
. O

But O
O O
' O
Brien O
added O
that O
, O
under O
current O
plans O
, O
sex O
and O
Internet O
addictions O
would O
be O
included O
in O
an O
appendix O
to O
DSM O
V O
, O
intended O
to O
encourage O
additional O
research O
that O
could O
lead O
to O
their O
inclusion O
in O
future O
editions O
. O

The O
first O
and O
obvious O
point O
to O
make O
about O
the O
Chinese O
study O
is O
that O
it O
' O
s O
very O
small O
and O
therefore O
not O
conclusive O
of O
anything O
. O

The O
second O
was O
made O
by O
Colin O
Drummond O
, O
professor O
of O
addiction O
psychiatry O
at O
Kings O
College O
London O
, O
which O
has O
the O
largest O
research O
centre O
for O
psychiatry O
in O
Europe O
, O
on O
the O
Today O
programme O
this O
morning O
. O

You O
can O
listen O
to O
him O
here O
and O
he O
' O
s O
just O
expanded O
his O
argument O
in O
a O
phone O
interview O
with O
me O
. O

I O
asked O
him O
whether O
internet O
addiction O
is O
a O
medical O
illness O
. O

He O
said O
: O
No O
. O

It O
' O
s O
interesting O
that O
people O
who O
use O
the O
internet O
excessively O
seem O
to O
have O
different O
brain O
structures O
compared O
with O
people O
who O
don O
' O
t O
but O
the O
big O
issue O
is O
whether O
we O
are O
looking O
at O
cause O
or O
effect O
. O

There O
is O
quite O
good O
evidence O
that O
people O
who O
engage O
in O
substance O
misuse O
and O
addictions O
and O
to O
some O
extent O
gambling O
do O
have O
problems O
with O
impulse O
control O
which O
fits O
with O
abnormalities O
in O
the O
frontal O
lobes O
of O
the O
brain O
similar O
to O
those O
in O
this O
study O
. O

But O
it O
is O
a O
big O
leap O
to O
go O
from O
there O
to O
suggest O
that O
the O
internet O
is O
re O
wiring O
your O
brain O
. O

If O
people O
have O
emotional O
problems O
and O
that O
leads O
them O
to O
use O
the O
internet O
obsessively O
then O
they O
obviously O
need O
help O
to O
deal O
with O
those O
problems O
, O
but O
that O
' O
s O
quite O
different O
to O
saying O
that O
the O
internet O
is O
addictive O
. O

Perhaps O
unhappy O
people O
or O
people O
with O
impulse O
control O
problems O
may O
well O
need O
some O
help O
. O

I O
' O
m O
not O
denying O
it O
' O
a O
problem O
for O
individuals O
, O
but O
trying O
to O
classify O
it O
as O
an O
addiction O
has O
risks O
attached O
to O
it O
. O

They O
are O
treating O
an O
addiction O
rather O
than O
emotional O
problems O
that O
might O
lead O
to O
the O
emotional O
behaviour O
. O

Excessively O
internet O
use O
is O
a O
symptom O
not O
a O
cause O
of O
a O
person O
' O
s O
problems O
. O

Are O
people O
drawn O
to O
the O
internet O
because O
they O
have O
impulse O
control O
issues O
? O

Probably O
, O
that O
' O
s O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
they O
have O
. O

The O
suggestion O
form O
this O
paper O
is O
that O
it O
' O
s O
working O
the O
other O
way O
round O
; O
that O
it O
' O
s O
changing O
people O
' O
s O
brain O
functioning O
. O

The O
implication O
people O
who O
disapprove O
of O
the O
internet O
can O
make O
is O
that O
it O
' O
s O
potentially O
addictive O
and O
a O
bad O
thing O
that O
could O
harm O
our O
youth O

A O
recent O
study O
that O
got O
published O
in O
the O
Journal O
of O
Neuroscience O
has O
found O
a O
compound O
in O
a O
Chinese O
tree O
which O
would O
not O
only O
help O
to O
overcome O
hangovers O
but O
would O
also O
help O
to O
leave O
alcohol O

The O
study O
was O
taken O
out O
at O
the O
University O
of O
California O
, O
where O
they O
discovered O
a O
compound O
known O
as O
hovenia O
which O
was O
extracted O
from O
the O
Chinese O
Raisin O
Tree O
. O

This O
compound O
is O
said O
to O
stop O
alcohol O
hangovers O
as O
well O
as O
reduce O
the O
alcohol O
dependency O
. O

One O
of O
the O
study O
researchers O
, O
Jing O
Liang O
, O
said O
that O
this O
cure O
used O
to O
be O
adopted O
by O
Chinese O
people O
about O
500 O
years O
ago O
for O
the O
same O
measure O
. O

So O
, O
they O
cannot O
affirm O
that O
it O
is O
the O
first O
discovery O
. O

It O
was O
there O
in O
the O
history O
but O
was O
with O
passage O
of O
time O
, O
its O
use O
was O
forgotten O
. O

In O
order O
to O
reach O
at O
above O
conclusion O
, O
they O
conducted O
an O
experiment O
on O
rats O
where O
they O
found O
that O
the O
compound O
neutralizes O
the O
intoxication O
effect O
and O
inhibits O
alcohol O
dependency O
. O

It O
was O
also O
found O
to O
reduce O
alcohol O
consumption O
in O
rodents O
, O
said O
Liang O
. O

He O
further O
affirmed O
, O
“ O
It O
’s O
basic O
research O
, O
but O
what O
I O
found O
interesting O
is O
it O
’s O
building O
on O
an O
old O
medication O
that O
is O
coming O
from O
Chinese O
medicine O
and O
they O
have O
been O
able O
to O
identify O
within O
this O
preparation O
a O
compound O
that O
seems O
to O
clear O
alcohol O
” O
. O

The O
study O
team O
is O
hoping O
to O
develop O
a O
drug O
using O
this O
compound O
which O
is O
remedy O
for O
both O
the O
treatments O
hangover O
and O
alcoholism O
. O

If O
they O
would O
be O
able O
to O
create O
such O
drug O
then O
they O
hope O
to O
save O
more O
than O
76 O

the O

Even O

2 O
. O
5 O
million O
people O
die O
every O
year O
due O
to O
it O
. O

So O
it O

The O
purpose O

of O
the O

employed O

Dr O

the O
dental O

not O
necessarily O
determine O
the O
type O

Strauss O
says O
patients O
appreciate O
the O
sedation O

option O
at O
